# APCSA2019

![warning](https://i.imgur.com/TxCC3c4.png) **You're on the ``linted`` branch maintained by [Popstarts](https://github.com/Popstarts). This branch only has simple versions of the assignment.**

This repository is used for saving my progress in APCSA 2019 ~ 2020.

some or a lot of the code have stuff that we don't learn at all, but I like it that way because it's more fun that way.

who doesn't like watching overkill stuff?

**THIS REPO MOST LIKELY WILL BE DELETED OR PRIVATED AFTER CLASS END.**
