# APCSA2019
This repository was used for saving my progress in APCSA 2019 ~ 2020. *It's completely finished now.*

some or a lot of the code have stuff that we don't learn at all. be aware.

please report non-working code to issues. or to me irl. 

and please don't blindly copypaste. *you're only screwing yourself over on the AP exam if you're taking it.*

## structure

should be straight-forward, the templates that edhesive gives me are inconsistant as hell so there had to be some changes.

all the class and filenames are preserved... i think?

## progress on class

- [x] finish everything
- [ ] final project
