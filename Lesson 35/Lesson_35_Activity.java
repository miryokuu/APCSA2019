 * Write four overloaded methods called randomize. 
 * Each method will return a random number based on the parameters that it receives:
 * randomize() - Returns a random int between min and max inclusive. Must have two int parameters. 
 * randomize() - Returns a random int between 0 and max inclusive. Must have one int parameter. 
 * randomize() - Returns a random double between min and max inclusive. Must have two double parameters. 
 * randomize() - Returns a random double between 0 and max inclusive. Must have one double parameter. 
 * 
 * Because these methods are overloaded, they should be declared in the same class. 
 * To simulate this, copy all four methods into the single Code Runner box.
